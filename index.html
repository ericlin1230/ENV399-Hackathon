	<h2>COVID-19 In COBWEB</h2>

	<p>
		Disease is a natural part of life, all living organisms will or have previously faced this obstacle at some point in their lives. Diseases often lead to a great deal of symptoms with varying mortality and morbidity. Hence prevention of disease is very important for upholding one’s standards of living. One of the primary weapons that humanity has developed in the battle against disease are vaccines; which according to the World Health Organization, primes the body’s immune defenses to fight off pathogens 1,2. However, there are immunocompromised individuals who are unable to benefit from protection of vaccines, and may even suffer adverse reactions to certain vaccinations. For these individuals another form of disease prevention must be implemented, and that is herd immunity.
